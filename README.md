## How to run the development server
Install dev dependencies. You must already have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed.
```bash
$ pip install -c constraints.txt
$ yarn
```
You may then run both the backend and client development servers using the following command:
```bash
$ yarn dev
```
You may then see the application at `localhost:8000`
